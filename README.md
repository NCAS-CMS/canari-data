Documents and code for canari data management


This repo will eventually include 
- all the documents which describe the CANARI Large Ensemble data environment,
- all the code we use to manipulate data in the CANARI workflow

Meanwhile, [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYErv41Ai5535LMHfU5wCUTFEnRFr39LbVoaKDHEZNg) is the draft file attributes specification.
